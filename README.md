 This code powers the "Social Distancer 3000," a creative final project for my digital art class. 
 The Social Distancer 3000 is a whimsical invention: a hat equipped with HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors. 
 When an object or person comes within 40 cm of the sensors, they trigger the DFPlayer Mini to play 
 pre-selected audio tracks. These tracks deliver playful, humorous "insults" designed to humorously 
 maintain personal space boundaries.

 An important note for contents of the DFPlayer SD card: Please make sure that you have a folder 
 labeled "mp3" that contains the sound files you intend to use. 
 Label the sound files as follows: "0001", "0002", "0003", etc. 

 The project is purely for entertainment and is not intended to cause harm. 
  Have fun!
